# Timelock

I built this contract in such a way that erc20 tokens can be locked and claimed after a set period. The credit of this codebase goes to Timothy because I learned how to build this from their [repo](https://github.com/second-state/simple-timelock-smart-contract/blob/main/README.md).

## What I Learned While Building This Project

- the best practice of documenting the ratio for my essential functions and variables
- proper understanding and handling of timestamp
- learned how to use ".add"
- learned how to use ".sub"
- how to transfer accidentally transferred tokens to the owner of a contract
- how to use the safeMath library for uint256
